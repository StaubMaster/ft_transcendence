	GamePlay:
		this is the simplest way to matchmake
			take the bottom 2 from RemainingUsers and put them in a Session
			Session should know it's in a Tournament and redirect to Send_All()
			Session should better return who won
			Winner gets added to top of RemainingUsers
		no parallel games, when 2 are playing, the others can see but not interact

		when RemainingUsers is 1
			thats the Winner
		when RemainingUsers is 0
			this should only really happen if both are Inactive ?
			Edgecase

		remove players that disconnect / log out
}
