how to import module ?

files have index files
I want the index.js ?
http Request has "Referer" in header that says the requesting file
there it says the file is .js so look for index.js


it seems to have worked
so everytime something asks for a directory, just look for an index file with the correct extention
but it was kinda slow because the server prints a lot



the site now takes a long time to load

made load a bit faster by not appending the file content to the header
and just writing it directly
