how to connect with other players:
- Player1 connects to server and gets an ID from the Server
- Player2 connects to server and gets an ID from the Server
- Player1 takes the ID from Player2 and sends an Invite
- Server send the Invite to Player2, where it is Displayed in a List
- Player2 Accepts Invite from Player1

each Player (JavaScript) needs to be able to:
- get an ID from the Server
- display the ID
- Acknowladge an Invite and add it to a List
- Acknowladge an Invite Cancel and remove it from the List
- Accapt an Invite

the Server needs to be able to:
- keep track of IDs and send them to Players
- foreward Invites to Players
 ? keep track of Players?
  ? this is only really needed for telling others when to remove the Invite from the list
  ? if the server keeps track of who got an Invite then it just tells those
 ? otherwise
  ? tell everyone everytime someone disconnects
  ? this shouldn't cause security convernes since IDs are reassigned everytime someone reconnects
  ? might cause spam if some connects and disconnects a lot
- foreward and Invire Accept to a Player
 - and start a Game for those Players



Data on Server-Side:

- List of Games
- Player:
  - WebSocket
  - ID
  - isInAGame
  - GameID ?

Data on Player-Side:

how to handle commands: (this is kind of just approaching GET):
- socket recieves a Message
- parse the Message / decide which command it is
? do an if else ?
? put each command into its own function so the if else is more organized
? make an extra class for commands ?

- put command functions into seperate files based on how simmilar they are
- make a class for commands
class CCommand
{
	string command_Name;
	function command_func();
}
- at the beginning of the program
